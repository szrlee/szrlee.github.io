I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), Shenzhen, China.
I am advised by [Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/214).
Previously, I received the M.S. \& B.E. in Computer Science with honors from [Huazhong University of Science \& Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/).
I was a research visiting student at Cornell with [John E. Hopcroft](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/).
I initiated and organized the [reinforcement learning seminar](https://rlseminar.github.io/) from 2019 to 2023.

üéì My research vision is to develop reliable interactive AI **agents** for complex environments.
During PhD, I focus on sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL), bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications.
I design **scalable architectures and algorithms** and create **fundamental tools**, recognized with awards üèÜ:

- Presidential PhD Fellowship
- SRIBD PhD Fellowship (Gold Class)
- Tencent AI PhD Fellowship
- Best Paper Award, 2024 Daoyuan Academic Forum
- Best Student Paper Award, 2024 IEEE SAM

üî¨ **Recent Achievement**:
Successfully extended my uncertainty-aware exploration algorithm to LLM value-guided search for multi-step reasoning.

#### Latest Updates (Swipe to Explore More! Follow me on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/RichardYRLi)!)
 üíª**July 2024**: I will deliver an **invited talk** at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming ([**ISMP**](http://ismp2024.gerad.ca)) in Montr√©al. [Slides](uploads/slides/HyperAgent_ISMP.pdf). [Recording](https://meeting.tencent.com/v2/cloud-record/share?id=VBA718MUvruzY8OnuGI95X8pXtzeK3DooYLckwPKh4M&from=3&record_type=1&is-single=true). Relevant publications include [1] [HyperAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10228) [2] [GPT-HyperAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195).

 ‚úàÔ∏è**July 2024**: I'll be at #ICML2024 in Vienna from July 21st to 27th! Also, don't miss my lightning talk on "Agile Human-AI Collaboration for #RiskOversight" at the #AlignmentWorkshop on 21st and 22nd. Check out the details in [tweets](https://twitter.com/RichardYRLi/status/1813959473339461934) and [ICML events](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/search?query=yingru).
 <!-- [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) accepted to . -->

 üéâ**July 2024**: Congratulations to the team! We received the ***Best Student Paper Award*** at **IEEE SAM**!

 üíª**June 2024**: Will present at ([**RLCN**](https://rlchina.org/)). Find [slides](uploads/slides/HyperAgent_RLCN.pdf) here.

 üíª**May 2024**: [**AISTATS**](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html), Valencia, Spain. Our [paper](/publication/li-2024-prior) offers the first prior-dependent analysis of PSRL under function approximation. This helps understand how integrating prior knowledge like historical data or pre-trained models (LLMs) enhances RL agent efficiency.

 üíª**May 2024**: Remote presentation [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) at the [**ICLR**](https://neurips.cc) in Vienna, Austria, during the Workshop on Bridging the Gap Between Practice and Theory in Deep Learning. HyperAgent represents a significant stride towards aligning theoretical foundations with practical deep RL applications.

 üíª**March 2024**: **Two Talks** at the Informs Optimization Society ([**IOS**](https://ios2024.rice.edu)) Conference at Rice University. **(1)** ["HyperAgent: A simple, efficient, scalable and provable RL framework for complex environments"](/talk/hyperagent-a-simple-efficient-scalable-and-provable-rl-framework/) and **(2)** ["A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling and Ensemble Sampling"](uploads/slides/TS_ES_bg.pdf).

 üéâ**Jan 2024**: [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) received [**Best Paper Award**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/erfgIgYJCjYg2aRTnqseuQ) in the third doctoral and postdoctoral [Daoyuan academic forum](/talk/hyperagent-a-simple-efficient-and-scalable-rl-framework-for-complex-environments/).

 ‚úàÔ∏è**December 2023**: [**NeurIPS**](https://neurips.cc), New Orleans üöÄ My research addresses **efficiency challenges in reinforcement learning (RL).** It encompasses both theoretical aspects of *high-dimentional probability* and *practical applications* in Deep RL [[1]](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent). I have developed a novel random projection tool for high-dimensional *sequentially dependent data*, a **non-trivial** martingale extension of Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss [[2]](/publication/li-2024-probability). üöÄ
