I am a Research Scientist at ByteDance, Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://tomluo123.github.io/). Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research and Tencent AI & Robotics X.

### Research Vision
I develop intelligent **agents** that reliably interact with complex environments. Through advances in reinforcement learning, optimization, and LLM reasoning & planning, I bridge foundational **theory** with **scalable algorithms** for trustworthy decision-making.

### Recent Honors
- Presidential PhD Fellowship
- Tencent AI PhD Fellowship
- Best Paper Award, 2024 Daoyuan Academic Forum
- Best Student Paper Award, 2024 IEEE SAM
