Mr. Yingru Li is a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), Shenzhen, China.
Fortunately, he is advised by [Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en).
He received the bachelor degree in Computer Science (ACM Honors Program) from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.cs.hust.edu.cn/) with an advisory of [Kun He](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/hekun/en/).
He was a research visiting student at Cornell University with [John E. Hopcroft](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/).
His Ph.D. research is supported by SRIBD Ph.D. Fellowship, Presidential Ph.D. Fellowship and [Tencent Ph.D. Fellowship](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index).

He organized [Reinforcement Learning Seminar](https://rlseminar.github.io/) in CUHK-SZ from 2019 to 2023.

- **[2024-05]** **[AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html)**, Valencia, Spain. Want to know how integrating prior knowledge, such as historical data or pre-trained models (LLMs), enhances RL agent efficiency before direct exploration? Our [paper](/publication/li-2024-prior) presents a novel prior-dependent analysis of PSRL bound under linear mixture model, offering a distinctive perspective.
