Mr. Yingru Li is a Ph.D. Candidate in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), Shenzhen, China.
Fortunately, he is advised by [Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en).
He received the bachelor degree in Computer Science (ACM Honors Program) from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.cs.hust.edu.cn/) with an advisory of [Kun He](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/hekun/en/).
He was a research visiting student at Cornell University with [John E. Hopcroft](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/).
His Ph.D. research is supported by SRIBD Ph.D. Fellowship, Presidential Ph.D. Fellowship and [Tencent AI Ph.D. Fellowship](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index).

He organized [Reinforcement Learning Seminar](https://rlseminar.github.io/) in CUHK-SZ from 2019 to 2023.

#### Latest Updates (Swipe to Explore More!)
 ‚úàÔ∏è**July 2024**: Will deliver an **Invited Long Talk** at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming ([**ISMP**](http://ismp2024.gerad.ca)), Montr√©al. The ISMP is the **leading triennial conference** focusing on [mathematical optimization](https://www.mathopt.org/?nav=ismp).

 üéâ**May 2024**: [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) accepted to [**ICML**](https://icml.cc)!

 üíª**May 2024**: [**AISTATS**](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html), Valencia, Spain. Our [paper](/publication/li-2024-prior) offers the first prior-dependent analysis of PSRL under function approximation. This helps understand how integrating prior knowledge like historical data or pre-trained models (LLMs) enhances RL agent efficiency.

 üíª**May 2024**: Remote presentation [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) at the [**ICLR**](https://neurips.cc) in Vienna, Austria, during the Workshop on Bridging the Gap Between Practice and Theory in Deep Learning. HyperAgent represents a significant stride towards aligning theoretical foundations with practical deep RL applications.

 üíª**March 2024**: **Two Talks** at the Informs Optimization Society ([**IOS**](https://ios2024.rice.edu)) Conference at Rice University. **(1)** ["HyperAgent: A simple, efficient, scalable and provable RL framework for complex environments"](/talk/hyperagent-a-simple-efficient-scalable-and-provable-rl-framework/) and **(2)** ["A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling and Ensemble Sampling"](uploads/slides/TS_ES_bg.pdf).

 üéâ**Jan 2024**: Our work about [**HyperAgent**](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent) received [**Best Paper Award**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/erfgIgYJCjYg2aRTnqseuQ) in the third doctoral and postdoctoral [Daoyuan academic forum](/talk/hyperagent-a-simple-efficient-and-scalable-rl-framework-for-complex-environments/).

 ‚úàÔ∏è**December 2023**: [**NeurIPS**](https://neurips.cc), New Orleans üöÄ My research addresses **efficiency challenges in reinforcement learning (RL).** It encompasses both theoretical aspects of *high-dimentional probability* and *practical applications* in Deep RL [[1]](/publication/li-2024-hyperagent). I have developed a novel random projection tool for high-dimensional *sequentially dependent data*, a **non-trivial** martingale extension of Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss [[2]](/publication/li-2024-probability). üöÄ
