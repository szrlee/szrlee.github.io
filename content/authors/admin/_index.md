üöÄ My research in RL encompasses both theoretical aspects of high-dim probability and practical applications in Deep RL. I have developed a novel random projection tool for sequentially dependent data, which extends the Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss lemma in a non-trivial way and effectively addresses **efficiency challenges in RL.** üöÄ

{{< icon name="square-rss" pack="fas" >}} **I am now actively seeking posdoctoral and research positions!** {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} my [resum√©](uploads/resume.pdf); my [cards](uploads/personal/Yingru_Cards_phd_candidates.pdf)
