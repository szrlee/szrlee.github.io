# abstract: We design efficient and scalable RL algorithms for complex environments with hypermodel and approximate Thompson sampling, which demonstrates significant efficiency gain in DRL benchmark problems (e.g. only 15\% data consumption and 5\% model parameters compared to SOTAs in Arcade Learning Environment. We developed new probability tools for the sequential random projection and sequential subspace embedding via stopping-time argument and self-normalized martingale, which can be regard as a non-trivial extension to the renowned Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma. The tools are then applied to the regret analysis of hypermodel-based TS-type algorithms in bandit and RL environments, achieving the same regret order of RLSVI and PSRL with cheap computation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Hypermodel for efficient incremental approximation of the posterior (uncertainty estimation) over complex models without leveraging conjugacy as encountering more data; Index sampling for approximate posterior sampling for data-efficient sequential decision-making. This approach is provably superior than ensemble sampling and Langevin Monte-carlo.

### Summary of contributions:

1. New probability tools in high-dimensional probability and statistics
- a non-trivial martingale extension of Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) for adaptively sampled data due to the sequential nature of RL;
- a unified and simple analysis for JL via high-dimension extension of Hanson-Wright.

2. Methodology for sequential-decision making
- hypermodel for efficient incremental approximation of the posterior (uncertainty estimation) over complex models without leveraging conjugacy as encountering more data;
- index sampling for approximate posterior sampling for data-efficient sequential decision-making.

3. Results for sequential-decision making
- Practically, our developed HyperAgent demonstrates its robust performance in large-scale deep RL benchmarks with significant efficiency gain in terms of both data and computation;
- Theoretically, first method to achieve logarithmic per-step computation and sublinear under tabular episodic RL among practically scalable algorithms.
