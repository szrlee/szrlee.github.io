# abstract: We design efficient and scalable RL algorithms for complex environments with hypermodel and approximate Thompson sampling, which demonstrates significant efficiency gain in DRL benchmark problems (e.g. only 15\% data consumption and 5\% model parameters compared to SOTAs in Arcade Learning Environment. We developed new probability tools for the sequential random projection and sequential subspace embedding via stopping-time argument and self-normalized martingale, which can be regard as a non-trivial extension to the renowned Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma. The tools are then applied to the regret analysis of hypermodel-based TS-type algorithms in bandit and RL environments, achieving the same regret order of RLSVI and PSRL with cheap computation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Approximate Thompson sampling (TS) with hypermodel can achieve the same regret order of TS with small elevated dimension in hypermodel, achieving both data and computation efficiency.
