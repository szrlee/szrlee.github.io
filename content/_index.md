        # I work on algorithms and theoretical foundations for interactive agents. My focus is on ensuring these agents operate reliably and safely in complex, uncertain, and human-in-the-loop environments, aligning their decisions with human objectives.
        #   This work necessitates advancements in methods for knowledge and uncertainty representation, exploration, adaptation, and decision-making. To achieve these goals, I use and develop **fundamental tools** in probability, optimization, game theory, and information theory. My methods have been **applied** to human-AI alignment and reliable & strategic operations. 
        #   The significance of my work has been recognized through invitations to speak at **prestigious forums**, including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, ISMP and INFORMS Annual Meetings, and through awards, such as the ***Best Paper Award*** at the 2024 Daoyuan academic forum and the ***Best Student Paper Award*** at the 2024 IEEE SAM.

          ### Key Contributions
          
          #### Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning
          My work advances scalable uncertainty representation and Thompson sampling frameworks for real-world applications where data acquisition is costly, bridging theory and practice. A notable project is "HyperAgent," designed to quantify and resolve epistemic uncertainty on optimal value \[Q^\star\] for scalable real-time sequential decision-making.

          - **Ensemble++ and Thompson sampling**:
            - **Neural Ensemble++ Architecture**: Overcomes the scalability challenges for independent ensembles and mitigates the ensemble coupling issue in shared-layer ensembles
            - **Ensemble Sampling Theory**: First rigorous analysis demonstrating ensemble sampling as a scalable and effective approximation of Thompson sampling
            - **Theoretical Impact**: Closed key theoretical gap in scalable exploration efficiency
          
          - **Large-Scale Systems**:
            - **HyperAgent**: Achieves significant gains in data and computational efficiency on deep RL benchmarks
            - **Memoire Framework**: Distributed replay memory system with 300+ CPU actors and 10+ GPU learners
            - **System Optimization**: Achieved 10x throughput via prioritized sampling and memory management
          
          - **Multi-Agent Strategic Learning**:
            - **Framework**: Integrates structure-aware modeling with no-regret learning for unknown repeated games
            - **Applications**: Enables efficient collaboration in traffic routing and competition in radar sensing
            - **Innovation**: Achieves significant sample budget savings by leveraging domain-specific utility structures
          
          #### LLM Reasoning and Agency
          I pioneer uncertainty-guided approaches to enhance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making tasks:
          
          - **Advanced Mathematical Reasoning**:
            - **Uncertainty-Guided Search**: Search with \[K\]-Thompson Sampling for strengthening LLM's multi-step reasoning
            - **Performance**: Significant improvements in solving complex mathematical problems
            - **Reliability**: Enhanced accuracy and interpretability in solution paths
          
          - **Medical Applications**:
            - **Hospital Referral Agent**: Deployed conversational system serving 16 hospitals nationwide
            - **Safety-First Design**: Control mechanisms ensuring adherence to medical protocols
            - **Practical Impact**: Streamlined patient flow and improved resource allocation
          
          This research advances both theoretical foundations and practical applications of interactive AI agents, with a focus on reliability and real-world impact.

# - I designed "HyperAgent" that quantifies and resolves epistemic uncertainty on optimal value $(Q^\star)$ for scalable real-time sequential decision-making.
#   - HyperAgent shows significant data and computation efficiency gains in large-scale deep RL benchmarks such as Atari suite.
#     - It can be used for **human-AI alignment and collaboration**, e.g. GPT-HyperAgent for content moderation with human feedback.
#   - Theoretical analysis confirms that:
#     - With logarithmic per-step computational complexity, HyperAgent's performance matches exact Thompson sampling (TS) in linear contextual bandits and Randomized Least-Square Value Iteration (RLSVI) in tabular RL environments. 
#     - Fundamental to this analysis is the first probability tool for sequential random projection I developed. 
# - I am working on **reliable and safe solutions** for customer, healthcare and business **operations**, via **inference-time algorithms** that leverages powerful cloud computing services on **foundation models** while augmenting necessary algorithmic modules in end devices.
#   - Control LLM decoding towards high outcome feedback via learned $Q^\star$.
