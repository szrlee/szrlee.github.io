      title: Research Highlights
      text: |-
        {{% callout note %}}
          I focus on algorithms and theory for **interactive agents** that operate in complex and uncertain environments. This work necessitates advancements in methods for knowledge and uncertainty representation, exploration, adaptation, and decision-making. To achieve these goals, I use and develop **fundamental tools** in probability, optimization, game theory, and information theory. The methods developed have been applied to gaming, human-AI alignment, and reliable & safe operations. (See full publication list in the [resume](uploads/resume.pdf)).
          {{< spoiler text="Click to view the short research statement" >}}
          ### Key Contributions
          One notable project is "HyperAgent," designed to quantify and resolve epistemic uncertainty on optimal value $Q^\star$ for scalable real-time sequential decision-making. HyperAgent demonstrates significant gains in data and computational efficiency in large-scale deep reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks, such as the Atari suite. It has also shown effectiveness in human-AI alignment and collaboration, such as GPT-HyperAgent for content moderation with human feedback. Theoretical analysis of HyperAgent confirms that with logarithmic per-step computational complexity, its performance matches exact Thompson sampling (TS) in linear contextual bandits and Randomized Least-Square Value Iteration (RLSVI) in tabular RL environments. This analysis is grounded in the first probability tool for sequential random projection that I developed.
          - **HyperAgent**: Efficient, scalable real-time decision-making.
            - **Data and computation efficiency**: Significant gains in deep RL benchmarks.
            - **Applications**: Human-AI alignment, e.g., content moderation with human feedback.
            - **Theory**: Matches performance of TS and RLSVI with logarithmic computational complexity, proved via fundamental probability tools.
          
          Another key area of my research is game-theoretic decision-making, focusing on minimizing adversarial regret in repeated unknown games. This includes learning to collaborate in traffic routing and compete in radar communications, resulting in significant budget savings. I have developed frameworks that synergies opponent/structure-aware reward modeling and no-regret learning/optimization.
          - **Game-theoretic Decision-making**: Minimizing adversarial regret in repeated unknown games.
            - **Applications**: Collaboration in traffic routing and competition in radar sensing, achieving significant budget savings.
            - **Frameworks**: Synergy between opponent/structure-aware reward modeling and no-regret learning/optimization.

          Currently, I am developing reliable and safe solutions for healthcare operations through inference-time algorithms. These algorithms leverage powerful cloud computing services on foundation models while augmenting necessary algorithmic modules in end devices. For example, controlling large language model (LLM) decoding towards high outcome feedback and minimum constraint violations via learned $Q^\star$.
          - **Reliable and Safe Operations**: for healthcare, customer and business services.
            - **Inference-time algorithms**: Leveraging cloud services and augmenting end devices.
            - **Control of LLM decoding**: Guided by learned $Q^\star$ for high outcome feedback and minimum constraint violations.
          
          This research aims to advance the field of interactive agents, contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
