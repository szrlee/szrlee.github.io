# - **Math Reasoning Agent**:
#   - Developed an agent acting as both prover and corrector, interacting with environments generating mathematical problems.
#   - **Impact on Trustworthiness**: Demonstrates reliable and transparent reasoning capabilities.



# - I designed "HyperAgent" that quantifies and resolves epistemic uncertainty on optimal value $(Q^\star)$ for scalable real-time sequential decision-making.
#   - HyperAgent shows significant data and computation efficiency gains in large-scale deep RL benchmarks such as Atari suite.
#     - It can be used for **human-AI alignment and collaboration**, e.g. GPT-HyperAgent for content moderation with human feedback.
#   - Theoretical analysis confirms that:
#     - With logarithmic per-step computational complexity, HyperAgent's performance matches exact Thompson sampling (TS) in linear contextual bandits and Randomized Least-Square Value Iteration (RLSVI) in tabular RL environments. 
#     - Fundamental to this analysis is the first probability tool for sequential random projection I developed. 
# - I am working on **reliable and safe solutions** for customer, healthcare and business **operations**, via **inference-time algorithms** that leverages powerful cloud computing services on **foundation models** while augmenting necessary algorithmic modules in end devices.
#   - Control LLM decoding towards high outcome feedback via learned $Q^\star$.
